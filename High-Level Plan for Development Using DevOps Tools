Define the System Architecture:

Frontend: A web application (React, Angular, or Vue.js).
Backend: A microservices architecture (Node.js, Python, or Java with REST APIs or GraphQL).
Database: RDS (PostgreSQL/MySQL) for transactional data and DynamoDB for caching frequently accessed data.
Search Engine: Elasticsearch for fast queries on routes, buses, and bookings.
Authentication: Cognito for secure user authentication.
Storage: S3 for storing static files and logs.
Infrastructure Setup:
Use Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools like Terraform or AWS CloudFormation to provision resources in AWS.

CI/CD Pipeline:
Implement automated build, test, and deployment pipelines using Jenkins, AWS CodePipeline, or GitHub Actions.

Monitoring & Logging:

Use CloudWatch for monitoring and log aggregation.
Add tools like Prometheus and Grafana for advanced dashboards.
Use AWS X-Ray for tracing API calls.
Scaling and Resiliency:

Set up Auto Scaling Groups (ASGs) for dynamic scaling.
Use AWS Elastic Load Balancers (ELB) for traffic distribution.
Deploy services in multiple Availability Zones (AZs) for fault tolerance.
Security:

Use AWS WAF for protection against web attacks.
Configure IAM roles and policies for least-privileged access.
Enable CloudTrail for logging API calls.
